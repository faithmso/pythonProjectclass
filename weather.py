"""
The goal of this project is to create a weather app that shows the current weather conditions and forecast for a
specific location.
Here are the steps that you can take to create this project.
    Use the requests library to make an API call to a weather service (e.g OpenWeatherMap) to retrieve the weather data
    for a specific location.

    use the json library to parse the json data returned by the API call.

    use the tkinter library to create a Gui for the app, including widgets such as labels, buttons and text boxes.

    use the pillow library to display weather icons.

    use the datetime library to display the current date and time.
